for the first project I will be making my own project called project 0 a prequel project which will automate
the process of adding new projects folders py files and such

the process will be a quick code menu - no gui - where the user for now will be able to load up a quick project
 or custom make own with variables such as a project folder name a main file name (default main.py)
  maybe  links into my py template project
  code first then gui
  shouldn't take more than a day
