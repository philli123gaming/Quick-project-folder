 Quick project folder with projects im grabbing and attempting from a youtube video then adding my own twists to them


for this project im using this video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpmFbWO6HPU
a video by tecxh with tim which helps create up to 9 hours worth of projects totaling to 21 projects

I want to try something like this as I know that the more you code the better you get (to an extent) and so I am goin

need work

for the first project I will be making my own project called project 0 a prequel project which will automate
the process of adding new projects folders py files and such
